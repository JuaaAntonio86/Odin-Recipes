	<h1>Instructions:</h1>
	<ol>
		<li style="font-weight:bold">Marinate the Chicken:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>In a large bowl, combine yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, lemon juice, red chili powder, garam masala, turmeric powder, and salt.</li>
			<li>Add the chicken pieces to the marinade, ensuring each piece is well-coated.</li>
			<li>Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, preferably overnight for deeper flavor.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Cook the Chicken:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Heat 1 tablespoon of butter and 1 tablespoon of oil in a large pan over medium heat.</li>
			<li>Add the marinated chicken pieces, cooking them until they are browned on all sides. This will take about 5-7 minutes.</li>
			<li>Once cooked, remove the chicken from the pan and set it aside.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Prepare the Sauce:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>In the same pan, add 2 tablespoons of butter and heat over medium flame.</li>

			<li>Stir in the ginger-garlic paste and cook for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</li>

		</ul>
		<li>Simmer the Chicken in the Sauce:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Add the cooked chicken back into the pan, stirring to coat the pieces in the sauce.</li>
			<li>Add garam masala and dried fenugreek leaves (Kasuri Methi), mixing them into the sauce.</li>
			<li>Stir in the heavy cream, reduce the heat, and let the dish simmer for 10-15 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
			<li>Adjust seasoning with sugar and salt if needed.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Garnish and Serve:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Once the sauce has thickened to your desired consistency, turn off the heat.</li>
			<li>Garnish with fresh coriander leaves.</li>
			<li>Serve hot with naan, roti, or basmati rice.</li>
